This plugin will create new instagram post based on the featured image in WordPress post. The plugin required to save your instagram account to the custom table created during the plugin activation.

>Please take a note: Instagram's API does not officially let someone post a photo to an account, the original code that used in this plugin was taken from this (http://lancenewman.me/posting-a-photo-to-instagram-without-a-phone/). Also, as mentioned in the original post, "Be cautioned that constantly logging into different accounts from the same IP address will almost certainly be a quick way to get your accounts banned. Just keep that in mind before proceeding with this script."
